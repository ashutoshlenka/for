KUBERNETS OBJECT
===================
1.pod
====
pod is a layer of abstractoion on top of a container.

why it is required ?
it is working like a translator,whatever kubernate command says that convert the nessary command to understand the container

2.service
=======
 host port connect to service port and service port connected to the container port

service object is a specific type of kubernets object which is tells how to do port mapping also maintaing the same ip ipadress of the host port unfortunatly how many times the the ipadress is changed 

3.NAMESPACE
======
it is a logical partition within the kubernets cluster.

4.Replication controller(outdated)
==================
used for loadbalancing and scalling

5.ReplicaSet(same as replication controller)
==============
it is a high level object using which activities like loadbalancing and scalling

6.Deployment
============
it is a high level kubernetes object, which can perform loadbalancing,scalling and also rolling update

7. statefulset
===============
 it stores data after deleting container

8.persistant volume
=============
it is the amount of storage that is reserved for volume

9.persistant volume claim
===========================
pod uses some amount of storage called .........

10.Horrizontal pod autoscalling
================================
depends upon the amount of load automatic the number of pod incresing or decresing 




 MASTER COMPONENTS
===================
1.container runtime(docker)

 2.KUbe apiserver
=================
 its a gate keeper or a validator (it checks the user has that permission to run a perticular kubernetes command or not )

4.kube scheduler
===============
its like quorum, it deceides where the pod should be created

5.control manager or controller 
================================
it maintain the desired count

6.etcd/xcd
=======
it is a repository which stores the key value.(both the kube scheduler and control manager picking up from the xcd and based on the information they perform )



SLAVE COMPONENTS
================
1.container runtime(docker)

2.kubelet
========
creating the pods and the container on the slave is called....

3.kube proxy
============
its a application which is ensure that all pods are related to one architecture will run on same slave or their near slave ,rather than runing on some remote slave to save timing.
